#        Jackie Singh is an American security consultant whose technology interests began at an early age-she was once an active participant in an                  established New York City hacker/cyberpunk collective.

#        Jackie began her professional career in the U.S. Army and first deployed to Iraq as a young idealist in 2003. She then spent the better part of that        decade working in Iraq and Africa in cleared roles. Jackie previously founded a boutique cybersecurity consultancy, Spyglass Security, and has held        several significant roles in defensive cybersecurity, including Principal Consultant at Mandiant and FireEye, Global Director of Incident Response          at Intel Security and McAfee, and Senior Incident Response & Threat Analyst on the campaign to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in 2020.

#        Jackie joined the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project in 2021 due to her desire to help counter advancing threats to civil liberties posed by        surveillance technologies.

#        She lives between New York and San Juan with her partner, their daughters, and a goldendoodle named Ziggy.

#             Humankind are deep down the software rabbit hole. Billions of us depend upon software that doesn't expose each of us to undue risk. Our                     dependence reaches far beyond those of us rich enough to work from cafes. Herders and subsistence farmers rely on their mobile phones for                   critical services even if these people live outside the "internet bubble". Who writes this software? Tens of millions of programmers across the             globe. Most of these do not work at "Enterprises" or even SMBs (Small Medium Businesses). And yet, every single one of these programmers can               add to our collective AppSec burden, i.e., exploitable conditions. If AppSec is to be truly global, we must embrace the challenges of a world               of software and software developers in order to truly be "global".
