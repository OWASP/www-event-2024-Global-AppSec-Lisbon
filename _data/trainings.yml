  Title: Intersectional Threat Modeling for Identifying, Ranking, and Mitigating Offline Threats, Risks, and Dangers - 1 Day Training
  URL: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-global-appsec-lisbon-2024-tickets-750689411237?aff=oddtdtcreator
  SectionId: sku_IWAHBB
  Description: >-
      This workshop introduces a logic, methodology, and toolset for intersectional, risk-centric, attack-driven threat modeling, tailored to both technical (i.e., computer/network-based) and non-technical practitioners (e.g., journalists, human rights defenders). This approach focuses on promoting proactive harm reduction through a focus on the context-sensitive aspects of human, organizational, and networked digital systems. Backed by dozens of case studies and more than a decade of direct application, this session will help enumerate how ‘technical’ and ‘non-technical’ users can benefit from the logic and methods of threat modeling. 

      Participants will be challenged to consider their own threat environment and to actively engage with the process through in-session brainstorming activities, risk assessments, and other illustrative exercises. This workshop does not require any technical know-how, but participants should come prepared to investigate and explore their own security challenges. Through a combination of traditional lecture, applied discussion, and hands-on activities participants will engage directly with the process of intersectional threat modeling.

      Privacy is hot! Now is the time to embrace this in-demand skillset. Believe it or not, privacy will even strengthen your security posture. Join this course now to learn about privacy engineering essentials and practical privacy-by-design approaches. With the lessons we’ll teach you, you’ll be able to effectively integrate privacy in existing security practices!

      Consumers are becoming more privacy-aware and expect privacy-oriented products. Likewise, globally emerging data protection legislations are forcing companies to integrate a technical approach for privacy into system design. With ever higher demands for privacy engineering, privacy by design, privacy-respecting systems - and increasing impact from the lack thereof - security teams are hard pressed to keep up with these emerging requirements and often feel like there is a substantial and growing skills gap.

      Traditional security approaches do not typically focus on this aspect, leaving individuals at risk. Fortunately, privacy by design does not have to be difficult, and in fact, can be nicely aligned with secure design best practices. Incorporating privacy into security with a proactive approach is essential, and can even become a force multiplier for more secure systems!

      This interactive hands-on training will introduce you to common privacy goals, and how these often fail. You'll learn about core privacy engineering fundamentals and get hands-on experience identifying and tackling potential privacy gaps and weaknesses, by leveraging by-design approaches such as threat modeling. As privacy shouldn’t be tackled in isolation, you will learn how to build privacy into the core of the software design and development process, aligned with security practices, showing how to gain increased efficiency and effectiveness in both domains.

      The course will cover these main topics
      - Introduction to Privacy Essentials
      - Architectural data mapping
      - Tracing the functionality
      - Overview of Privacy Threat Modeling
      - Analyzing for Privacy Threats
      - Privacy controls and mitigation strategies
      - Putting it all together - Full Privacy Process

      Each of these interactive modules will teach you both the technical skills and social aspects essential for successful privacy engineering, explain how they align with corresponding security practices, and highlight how these privacy skills can strengthen your security posture. With plenty of hands-on experience through a set of exercises, class discussions, and productive collaboration, you'll gain confidence to improve the privacy posture of your system using established design techniques, so you can take these practical skills back to your security practice.

      You bought the application security tools, you have the findings, but now what? Many organisations find themselves drowning in “possible vulnerabilities”, struggling to streamline their processes and not sure how to measure their progress.

      If you are involved in using SAST, DAST or SCA tools in your organisation, these may be familiar feelings to you. In this course you will learn how to address these problems and more (in a vendor-neutral way), with topics including

      <li>What to expect from these tools?</li>
      <li>Customising and optimising these tools effectively</li>
      <li>Building tool processes which fit your business</li>
      <li>Automating workflows using CI/CD without slowing it down</li>
      <li>Showing the value and improvements you are making</li>
      <li>Faster and easier triage through smart filtering</li>
      <li>How to focus on fixing what matters and cut down noise</li>
      <li>Techniques for various alternative forms of remediation</li>
      <li>Comparison of the different tool types covered</li>

      To bring the course to life and let you apply what you learn, you will work in teams on table-top exercises where you design processes to cover specific scenarios, explain and justify your decisions to simulated stakeholders and practice prioritising your remediation efforts.

      For these exercises, you will work based on specially designed process templates (which we will provide) which you can use afterwards to apply these improvements within your own organisation.

      Be ready to work in a group, take part in discussions and present your findings and leave the course with clear strategies and ideas on how to get less stress and more value from these tools.

      This course is the culmination of years of experience gained via practical penetration testing of mobile applications as well as countless hours spent in research. We have structured this course around the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) and relevant items of the OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS), so this course covers and goes beyond the OWASP Mobile Top Ten. This course provides participants with actionable skills that can be applied immediately from day 1.

      Please note our courses are 100% hands-on, we do not lecture students with boring bullet points and theories, instead we give you practical challenges and help you solve them, teaching you how to troubleshoot common issues and get the most out of this training. As we try to keep both new and advanced students happy, the course is very comprehensive and we have not met any student able to complete all challenges during the class, therefore training continues after the course through our frequently updated training portal, for which you keep lifetime access, as well as unlimited email support.

      Get a FREE taste for this training, including access to video recording, slides and vulnerable apps to play with 
      4 hour workshop - https://7asecurity.com/free-workshop-mobile-practical 

      Each section starts with a brief introduction to the mobile platform for that section and then continues with a look at static analysis, moves on to dynamic checks finishing off with a nice CTF session to test the skills gained.

      Day 1 - Focused specifically on Android. We start with understanding applications and then deep dive into static and dynamic analysis of the applications at hand. This section is packed with hands-on exercises and CTF-style challenges.

      Day 2 - Focused on iOS. We start with understanding iOS Architecture and various security precautions in place. We then focus on static and dynamic analysis of the applications at hand. The section is filled with hands-on exercises ending with a CTF for more practical fun.

      Format - The course combines theory and hands-on practical exercises. The participants start by learning about web application vulnerabilities. They are then given access to a purpose-built web application environment that contains the bugs and coding errors they have learned about. This provides an ideal ‘real-life’ opportunity to exploit these vulnerabilities in a safe environment.
